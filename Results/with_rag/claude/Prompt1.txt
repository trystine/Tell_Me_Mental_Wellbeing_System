User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I sometimes feel alone. I deeply crave companionship or someone to share my day to day life with. I am surrounded by my friends who hop from one relationship to another and often I just wonder when it will happen to me. When will I find someone special with whom I can be with?

Bot: It's understandable to feel that longing for companionship, especially when you see friends moving through relationships around you. That feeling of "when will it be my turn?" can be quite profound.

The desire for meaningful connection is deeply human. While there's no predetermined timeline for when you'll meet someone special, this period of being on your own might be offering you valuable time for self-discovery and clarity about what you truly want in a relationship.

Have you found yourself focusing more on what seems to be missing rather than what might be developing within you during this time? Sometimes the periods when we feel most alone can actually be preparing us for deeper connections when they do arrive.
