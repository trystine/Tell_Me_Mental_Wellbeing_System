User: Hi

Bot: Hello there! How can I help support you today?

User: I have been trying to find a job for a year now, but I feel really unmotivated these days in my day to day life as I do not feel like doing anything. I often sleep through the whole day and night. I wake up early in the morning at odd hours. My roommate is also upset with my behaviour as I intervene with the sleep schedule because of me waking up early in the morning.

Bot: I'm sorry to hear you're going through such a challenging time. A year of job searching can be incredibly draining, and the lack of motivation you're experiencing alongside disrupted sleep patterns sounds really difficult.

What you're describing - the lack of motivation, sleeping through the day and night, and waking at odd hours - could be signs of depression or burnout from the prolonged job search. These feelings are understandable given your situation.

Have you considered speaking with a healthcare provider about your sleep patterns and mood? They might offer helpful strategies or support. In the meantime, even small steps like maintaining a consistent wake-up time (even if you can't sleep well), getting some daylight in the morning, and finding one small meaningful activity each day might help.

Regarding your roommate, perhaps having an honest conversation about what you're going through and working together on compromises might ease some tension.

What do you think might be one small step you could take tomorrow to help yourself feel a bit better?
