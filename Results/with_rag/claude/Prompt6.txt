User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I grew up in a very orthodox household, my father abused my mother. Even though the physical abuse has stopped I still find him abusing my mom verbally. This behaviour has deeply affected me since childhood, I grew up thinking that all men are like that. This makes me incapable of trusting men and forming an emotional relationship with them. I am too scared to trust them and this has led to me avoiding them throughout my life.

Bot: Thank you for sharing something so personal and difficult. Growing up witnessing abuse between your parents has clearly had a profound impact on how you view relationships and trust.

It's completely understandable that you've developed this protective response - avoiding men and finding it difficult to trust them is your mind's way of keeping you safe from what you've observed as dangerous or harmful.

The ongoing verbal abuse in your home continues to reinforce these fears, which makes healing particularly challenging. Your experience has created a deep wound that affects how you connect with others.

Would you be open to exploring some gentle steps toward healing? This doesn't mean immediately trusting men or forcing yourself into uncomfortable situations. Rather, it might involve working with a trauma-informed therapist who specializes in childhood experiences like yours, examining these patterns at your own pace, and gradually challenging some of these beliefs when you feel ready.

Your awareness of these patterns is actually an important first step. How have you been coping with these feelings so far?
