User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I recently lost my family in a car crash. I am deeply affected by it as I was very close to them and loved them so much. How to find the hope to carry on with life.

Bot: I'm deeply sorry for your profound loss. Losing your family in such a tragic way is an absolutely devastating experience, and the pain you're feeling is completely understandable.

Right now, it might be difficult to imagine how to carry on. Please know that grief isn't something you need to "get over" - it's a process of learning to live with your loss in a way that honors your family while still finding meaning.

In the immediate term:
- Allow yourself to fully feel your grief without judgment
- Consider connecting with a grief counselor who specializes in traumatic loss
- Look into local or online support groups for those who have experienced similar losses

Finding hope again may come in small moments - perhaps in memories of your family, in honoring what they valued, or in living in ways that would make them proud.

Would it help to talk more about your family and what they meant to you? Sometimes sharing those memories can be both painful and healing.
