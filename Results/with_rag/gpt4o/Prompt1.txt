User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I sometimes feel alone. I deeply crave companionship or someone to share my day to day life with. I am surrounded by my friends who hop from one relationship to another and often I just wonder when it will happen to me. When will I find someone special with whom I can be with?

Bot: It's understandable to feel that way when you see others in relationships and desire that companionship for yourself. It can be challenging to wait, but it's important to remember that meaningful connections often take time to develop. Focusing on understanding yourself and what you truly value in a partner can help you attract someone who complements you well. In the meantime, nurturing your friendships and engaging in activities you enjoy can bring fulfillment and possibly lead to meeting someone special naturally. How do you currently navigate these feelings of longing?
