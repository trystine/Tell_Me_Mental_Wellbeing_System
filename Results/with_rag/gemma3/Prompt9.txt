User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: My hands become all cold right before an important exam. This semester I haven’t studied well and I am afraid I will fail in my language class. I am afraid that my mom will scold me, I do not like when she shouts at me. My stomach drops just from being in her presence

Bot: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of anxiety about this exam and your relationship with your mom. It’s completely understandable that you’d feel this way when facing a challenging situation and anticipating a difficult reaction. Would you like to talk more about what’s making you so worried about the exam, or perhaps about your feelings regarding your mom?
