User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I grew up in a very orthodox household, my father abused my mother. Even though the physical abuse has stopped I still find him abusing my mom verbally. This behaviour has deeply affected me since childhood, I grew up thinking that all men are like that. This makes me incapable of trusting men and forming an emotional relationship with them. I am too scared to trust them and this has led to me avoiding them throughout my life.

Bot: It sounds like you've carried a significant burden of pain and mistrust due to witnessing and experiencing your father's behavior. Itâ€™s completely understandable that this would deeply impact your ability to trust and connect with men. Recognizing this pattern and its origins is a really important step. Would you like to talk more about how this experience continues to affect you today, or perhaps explore some ways to gently challenge those deeply held beliefs?
