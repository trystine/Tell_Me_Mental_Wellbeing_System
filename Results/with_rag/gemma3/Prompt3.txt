User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I have been trying to find a job for a year now, but I feel really unmotivated these days in my day to day life as I do not feel like doing anything. I often sleep through the whole day and night. I wake up early in the morning at odd hours. My roommate is also upset with my behaviour as I intervene with the sleep schedule because of me waking up early in the morning.

Bot: That sounds incredibly challenging, and it takes a lot of strength to reach out when you’re feeling this way. It’s completely understandable to lose motivation and struggle with daily routines when you’re facing job searching and feeling so disconnected. Let’s explore this further – could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on that’s contributing to these feelings?
