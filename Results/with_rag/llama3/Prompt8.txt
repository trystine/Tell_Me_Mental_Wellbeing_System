User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I kind of hate my parents for not giving me the same care and validation as they give to my elder brother. Being a second child is hard and I always have to make extra efforts for them to focus on me

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It can be really tough to feel like you're not getting the same level of care and attention as your sibling. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel like you're not being validated by your parents? Was there a particular situation or experience that stood out to you?
