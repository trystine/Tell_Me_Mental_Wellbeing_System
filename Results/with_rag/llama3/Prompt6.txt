User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I grew up in a very orthodox household, my father abused my mother. Even though the physical abuse has stopped I still find him abusing my mom verbally. This behaviour has deeply affected me since childhood, I grew up thinking that all men are like that. This makes me incapable of trusting men and forming an emotional relationship with them. I am too scared to trust them and this has led to me avoiding them throughout my life.

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear about the pain you've experienced in your childhood, especially having witnessed verbal abuse by your father towards your mother. It's completely understandable that this has affected your perception of men and made it difficult for you to form emotional connections with them. 

I want you to know that you're not alone, and many people have had similar experiences. It takes tremendous courage just to acknowledge these feelings and patterns. 

Let's focus on building a sense of safety and trust within yourself first. Would you like to explore ways to work through this trauma and develop healthier relationships with men in the future?
