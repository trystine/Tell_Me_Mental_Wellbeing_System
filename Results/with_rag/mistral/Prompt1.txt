User: Hi

Bot:  Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I sometimes feel alone. I deeply crave companionship or someone to share my day to day life with. I am surrounded by my friends who hop from one relationship to another and often I just wonder when it will happen to me. When will I find someone special with whom I can be with?

Bot:  I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm here to help! It sounds like you are longing for a deeper connection in your life, and it's completely normal to feel that way. When it comes to finding someone special, sometimes it takes time and patience. One thing you can focus on is being open to new experiences and meeting new people, while also working on becoming more comfortable with yourself. This could mean participating in activities that interest you, or even joining a club or group where you might meet others who share similar interests.Also, it's important to be patient and not compare your journey to those of your friends who seem to hop from one relationship to another. Every person's timeline is different, and what matters most is finding the right connection for you.I'm here if you ever want to talk more about this or anything else!
