User: Hi

Bot:  Hello! How can I support you today?

User: I have been in a relationship with this girl for about two years now. I like her and think she is really a good person but I donâ€™t see our future together. I am very ambitious, she is not that excited about the future or serious about her career. Initially I tried helping her, but it is too exhausting as I can notice the lack of effort from her end. I want someone who is ambitious and as hardworking as I am. I am unhappy in this relationship and want to break up with her but afraid she will take it the wrong way.

Bot:  It sounds like you're going through a difficult time, and I'm here to help you navigate this situation. Breaking up is never easy, especially when feelings are involved. However, it seems that your ambition and drive may not align with your partner's, which can lead to long-term unhappiness for both of you.

It's important to have an open and honest conversation about your concerns with her. Express your feelings in a compassionate way, but also be clear about your needs and expectations for the future. Remember that everyone has their own pace when it comes to career goals and personal growth.

If she is willing to work on her ambition and make changes for the better, then it might be worth continuing the relationship. However, if she's not open to change or improvement, you may need to reconsider your future together.

Breaking up can be hard, but remember that it's essential to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. If this relationship is causing you more stress than joy, it might be best for both of you to part ways amicably. Wishing you all the best during this challenging time.
