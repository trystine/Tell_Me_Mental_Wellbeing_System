User: Hi

Bot:  Hello! How can I support you today?

User: I think I have an alcohol problem. Everyday after office, I feel tired and to relax and get out of my office zone. I drink a glass of wine. Initially it started with one glass or two. But lately I have been drinking three to four glasses a day before bed.

Bot:  It's great that you've reached out for help. Alcohol consumption can become problematic when it starts affecting your daily life and well-being, as it seems to be the case with you. To start addressing this issue, consider setting a goal for yourself such as limiting your alcohol intake or abstaining from drinking entirely.

I recommend seeking support from friends, family, or professionals to help maintain accountability and offer additional guidance during this process. If you feel overwhelmed or need more immediate assistance, please reach out to local hotlines that can provide further resources and support. Take care of yourself!
