User: Hi

Bot:  Hello! How can I support you today?

User: I grew up in a very orthodox household, my father abused my mother. Even though the physical abuse has stopped I still find him abusing my mom verbally. This behaviour has deeply affected me since childhood, I grew up thinking that all men are like that. This makes me incapable of trusting men and forming an emotional relationship with them. I am too scared to trust them and this has led to me avoiding them throughout my life.

Bot:  I'm really sorry to hear about your experiences growing up in such a difficult environment. It sounds like you have been deeply affected by the violence and abuse you witnessed, and it has left lasting impacts on your ability to form emotional relationships with others. This is a common experience for people who grew up in abusive households, as it can create patterns of distrust and fear that make it difficult to connect with others.

One approach to dealing with this is to seek out therapy, which can help you process the trauma you experienced and learn coping mechanisms to manage your emotions and build trust. It may also be helpful to find support groups or communities where you can connect with others who have had similar experiences, as this can provide a sense of validation and understanding that can be healing.

In addition to seeking professional help, it may be beneficial to explore self-care practices that can help you manage your emotions and build resilience. This could include things like meditation, exercise, journaling, or spending time in nature. It's important to prioritize taking care of yourself and nurturing your own wellbeing as a way of building the foundation for healthy relationships in the future.

I wish you all the best as you navigate this difficult journey, and I am here to support you however I can. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to reach out.
