User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I have been trying to find a job for a year now, but I feel really unmotivated these days in my day to day life as I do not feel like doing anything. I often sleep through the whole day and night. I wake up early in the morning at odd hours. My roommate is also upset with my behaviour as I intervene with the sleep schedule because of me waking up early in the morning.

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling unmotivated and struggling with your job search. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional fatigue, which can be really tough to deal with. Can you tell me more about what's going on? What are some things that you used to enjoy doing, but now feel too exhausting or unappealing?
