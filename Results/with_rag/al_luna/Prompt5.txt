User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I feel like an imposter in my office. I am surrounded by talented individuals and I always feel hesitant to share my ideas with them because I feel incapable and scared that someone will find out that I am not that smart and would treat me poorly or judge me because of it.

Bot: It sounds like you're feeling really uncertain about your abilities and afraid of being judged by others. That can be a really tough spot to be in. Can you tell me more about what's been going on and how this feeling has been impacting you?
