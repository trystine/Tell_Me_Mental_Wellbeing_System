User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I grew up in a very orthodox household, my father abused my mother. Even though the physical abuse has stopped I still find him abusing my mom verbally. This behaviour has deeply affected me since childhood, I grew up thinking that all men are like that. This makes me incapable of trusting men and forming an emotional relationship with them. I am too scared to trust them and this has led to me avoiding them throughout my life.

Bot: I'm so sorry to hear about the trauma you experienced growing up. It's completely understandable that the verbal abuse between your parents has had a lasting impact on you, making it difficult for you to trust men and form emotional relationships with them. That must be incredibly painful and isolating.

Can you tell me more about what comes up for you when you think about forming relationships with men? What are some of the specific fears or concerns that hold you back from being closer to someone you care about?
