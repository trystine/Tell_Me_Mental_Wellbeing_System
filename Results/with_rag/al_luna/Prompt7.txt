User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I have been in a relationship with this girl for about two years now. I like her and think she is really a good person but I donâ€™t see our future together. I am very ambitious, she is not that excited about the future or serious about her career. Initially I tried helping her, but it is too exhausting as I can notice the lack of effort from her end. I want someone who is ambitious and as hardworking as I am. I am unhappy in this relationship and want to break up with her but afraid she will take it the wrong way.

Bot: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your feelings and consider ending a relationship, especially when you care about the other person. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel unhappy in this relationship? What are some specific concerns or differences that you've noticed between you and your partner?
