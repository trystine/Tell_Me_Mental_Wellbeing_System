Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: My hands become all cold right before an important exam. This semester I haven’t studied well and I am afraid I will fail in my language class. I am afraid that my mom will scold me, I do not like when she shouts at me. My stomach drops just from being in her presence

Bot: I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing these intense feelings before your exams; it sounds incredibly tough and stressful for you both academically and personally with regards to the anxiety surrounding interactions with your mom.

Your hands getting cold could be a symptom of nervousness, which is quite common when facing high-pressure situations like important tests. I know it's distressing that this fear affects not only how you're doing in class but also has an impact on one of our most fundamental needs: feeling safe and comfortable around loved ones.


Have you been able to talk with anyone about these fears? Whether it’s a teacher, counselor at school or someone close who understands what your family situation is like – they might be the best person for supporting both academically (like discussing study strategies) as well as emotionally. Remember that it's completely okay not have all of this figured out right now and reaching out can really help.


For dealing with nervousness before exams, some people find it helpful to practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation – these might also provide you a sense of calm when you're around your mom too.

Again I am sorry that you've had an unpleasant experience in the past. Please know there are steps we can take together and resources available for both academic success (like tutoring) and emotional wellbeing.


Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like more help or someone specific who you think could support you better; I'm here whenever you're ready.
