User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I think I have an alcohol problem. Everyday after office, I feel tired and to relax and get out of my office zone. I drink a glass of wine. Initially it started with one glass or two. But lately I have been drinking three to four glasses a day before bed.

Bot: I'm really glad you reached out for support on this matter—it takes courage, especially when you're dealing with something challenging like alcohol consumption habits that may not be serving your best interests.

It sounds as though you've noticed significant changes in both the amount and frequency of drinking over time. If these behaviors are causing feelings of fatigue or making it difficult to unwind after work—rather than helping you relax—they might indeed indicate a pattern that's worth addressing for healthier coping mechanisms.


Your well-being is important, so I'd suggest considering seeking support from someone who can help guide your next steps in this process safely and confidentially. This could be speaking with friends close to the situation or reaching out professionally through resources like hotlines that specialize in substance use concerns.

Remember—you're not alone even though it may feel isolating at times—and there are pathways forward towards recovery, should you choose them.


Is there anything specific you'd want help exploring right now? Or any particular aspect of this experience you're seeking advice on or to understand better?
