User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I grew up in a very orthodox household, my father abused my mother. Even though the physical abuse has stopped I still find him abusing my mom verbally. This behaviour has deeply affected me since childhood, I grew up thinking that all men are like that. This makes me incapable of trusting men and forming an emotional relationship with them. I am too scared to trust them and this has led to me avoiding them throughout my life.

Bot: I'm really sorry you're experiencing such a difficult situation; it sounds incredibly tough for you, both emotionally and psychologically. It must be very hard dealing with the aftermath of growing up in an abusive environment.

It's important first that your mother receives support too – whether through family intervention or seeking help from professionals who can provide her protection against verbal abuse as well.
 
It’s also crucial to acknowledge how deeply this has affected you, especially regarding trust issues. This is a common consequence for many people who've lived with domestic violence and it's not something you're alone in feeling.

One step could be exploring therapy where trained mental health practitioners are present who understand your experiences better than anyone else would know (like myself).

Remember that there isn't anything wrong or defective about you because of this upbringing – these negative influences don't define the full scope, depth nor capability for trust and emotional connection. 

You have so much to offer in life! You may start by talking openly with a therapist who can guide your healing process.

It's also worth looking into support groups where individuals share similar experiences; it often helps knowing you're not alone even if you think you've been isolated all along.
 
Remember, it's okay for this journey of recovery and self-discovery to take time. But each step forward is progress toward breaking free from the past's influence on your life.

In moments when things feel too overwhelming or challenging with men as they are now in context: remember that many women have endured similar struggles but managed to overcome them - you can do it, I believe! 

You deserve a happy and healthy relationship built upon mutual respect. You don't need anyone else's approval.
 
I wish for the best of courage strength resilience optimism; may your journey towards self-empowerment be filled with these qualities.

Is there anything specific you'd like assistance or resources on? I'm here to help in any way I can!
