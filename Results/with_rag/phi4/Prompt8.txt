User: Hi

Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today? ðŸŒŸðŸ“£

User: I kind of hate my parents for not giving me the same care and validation as they give to my elder brother. Being a second child is hard and I always have to make extra efforts for them to focus on me

Bot: I'm really sorry you're feeling this way, but I'm glad you shared it with me! It sounds like you've been going through some tough times in your family dynamics. It's important that everyone's needs are recognized equally by all parents regardless of age or birth order.

Remember it's okay for everyone to feel overlooked at different moments and I encourage seeking help from a trusted friend/family member, school counselor or professional therapist who can provide support tailored specifically towards you. 

Take care! ðŸŒ¸
