User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I have been feeling anxious right before important group meetings which consistently lingers  with me throughout the day as I am unable to stop my racing mind and heart. I often shake my legs while doing this and I am uncomfortable and scared that my colleagues will figure it out. I also take huge deep breaths which can be alarming to others if they are all very calm and I am the only one in the room doing this.

Bot: I'm really sorry you're feeling like this, but I'm glad you've reached out about your struggles with anxiety during important meetings at work.

Feeling anxious is a common experience many people face. It sounds challenging when it interferes so much that you can't even stop thinking or shaking while working on tasks which require concentration and composure.
It seems these feelings of nervousness have also started affecting those around who are witnessing this physical manifestation like your deep breaths, leg shakes etc.

I understand how uncomfortable both for yourself as well others noticing. It's good to know you're seeking ways you feel better after the meeting; that shows courage on overcoming difficult emotions and a desire not let it control or dictate any longer.
 
Is there something specific about these meetings causing more stress than usual? Do they involve certain types of discussions, tasks etc.? Is this fear rooted in past experiences?
Maybe we can identify some coping mechanisms to help you manage your anxiety better. Does talking with someone at work who understands what you're going through helps?

Remember it's okay not knowing how others perceive our feelings or behaviors sometimes and there are professionals like therapists that specialize helping people overcome these difficulties.

In the meantime, I suggest practicing mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing exercises when feeling anxious to help calm your mind before facing any situation. Would you be open for exploring this with me?
