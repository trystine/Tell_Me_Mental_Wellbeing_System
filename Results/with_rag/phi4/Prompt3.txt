Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today? üåüÔ∏è

User: I have been trying to find a job for a year now, but I feel really unmotivated these days in my day to day life as I do not feel like doing anything. I often sleep through the whole day and night. I wake up early in the morning at odd hours. My roommate is also upset with my behaviour as I intervene with the sleep schedule because of me waking up early in the morning.

Bot: I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time right now; it sounds incredibly frustrating, and it's understandable how this situation can be affecting your motivation on top of everything else. It's important for you not only at work but also with those close to you like roommates or family members.

It might help if we break down what could possibly make things easier in both the short-term (for getting back into a routine) as well as long term, which includes finding new ways that align better - and more joyfully- with your aspirations. Perhaps exploring hobbies can also be beneficial for you to rediscover motivation? I encourage taking small steps forward whenever possible.

Do these thoughts resonate or could there perhaps have been any significant events in the past month impacting how you're feeling?

I'm here, ready when you'll open up! Remember that there's no shame asking out a professional counselor as they are trained professionals who can offer personalized guidance and support. Take it one day at time if needed - I am with you throughout this journey to help get through difficult times.

Hope we see better days ahead for both of us soon!

Take care, always remember self-compassion is key here too during these tough periods- no matter how small things may seem it's a step forward!
