User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I feel like an imposter in my office. I am surrounded by talented individuals and I always feel hesitant to share my ideas with them because I feel incapable and scared that someone will find out that I am not that smart and would treat me poorly or judge me because of it.

Bot: It sounds like you're feeling a bit self-doubting and uncertain about sharing your ideas in the office. Can you tell me more about what's driving this feeling? Is there something specific that happened or someone who made you feel this way?
