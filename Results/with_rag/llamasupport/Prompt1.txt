User: Hi

Bot: Hi there! How can I support you today?

User: I sometimes feel alone. I deeply crave companionship or someone to share my day to day life with. I am surrounded by my friends who hop from one relationship to another and often I just wonder when it will happen to me. When will I find someone special with whom I can be with?

Bot: It sounds like you're yearning for a deeper connection with someone, feeling like you're missing out on meaningful relationships. You've got a strong desire for companionship and sharing life's experiences with someone special. That's totally understandable! Can you tell me more about what "someone special" means to you? What qualities or characteristics would they need to have for you to feel truly connected?
