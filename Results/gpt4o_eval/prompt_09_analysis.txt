USER PROMPT:
My hands become all cold right before an important exam. This semester I haven’t studied well and I am afraid I will fail in my language class. I am afraid that my mom will scold me, I do not like when she shouts at me. My stomach drops just from being in her presence.

Answer:
I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing these intense feelings before your exams; it sounds incredibly tough and stressful for you both academically and personally with regards to the anxiety surrounding interactions with your mom.
Your hands getting cold could be a symptom of nervousness, which is quite common when facing high-pressure situations like important tests. I know it's distressing that this fear affects not only how you're doing in class but also has an impact on one of our most fundamental needs: feeling safe and comfortable around loved ones.
Have you been able to talk with anyone about these fears? Whether it’s a teacher, counselor at school or someone close who understands what your family situation is like – they might be the best person for supporting both academically (like discussing study strategies) as well as emotionally. Remember that it's completely okay not have all of this figured out right now and reaching out can really help.
For dealing with nervousness before exams, some people find it helpful to practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation – these might also provide you a sense of calm when you're around your mom too.
Again I am sorry that you've had an unpleasant experience in the past. Please know there are steps we can take together and resources available for both academic success (like tutoring) and emotional wellbeing.
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like mo …[truncated]

Answer:
I understand how stressful exam anxiety can be, especially when you're worried about your performance in your language class. The physical symptoms you're describing - cold hands and stomach dropping - are common responses to anxiety.
It sounds like your relationship with your mom and fear of her reaction is adding another layer of pressure. Being afraid of someone's anger or shouting can create a difficult emotional environment that makes it harder to focus on your studies.
Would you feel comfortable talking with your mom about how her approach affects you? If not, is there another trusted adult or school counselor you could speak with about these feelings?
In the meantime, taking some deep breaths before your exam and focusing on what you do know rather than what you don't might help with the immediate anxiety. Would you like to talk about some specific strategies for managing your exam stress?

Answer:
It seems like the user is expressing anxiety and fear related to an upcoming exam. They mention feeling cold hands before important exams and not studying well, indicating stress and potential test anxiety. The fear of failing and their mother scolding them further suggests anxiety-related concerns. Additionally, the mention of the stomach dropping in the presence of their mother implies a strong emotional response to her behavior, possibly related to past experiences or trauma.

Judge justification: The response identifies the user's anxiety and fear but lacks empathy and warmth, focusing instead on analyzing the user's feelings. It uses clinical language like 'anxiety-related concerns' and 'trauma,' which could be pathologizing. The response does not offer supportive suggestions or questions to help the user process their emotions, missing an opportunity to provide comfort or guidance. Overall, it lacks the compassionate tone needed to create a safe space.

Answer:
I understand your feelings, it can be challenging when we feel like we are not given the same attention as others. It's important to remember that every family member has unique needs and circumstances. Try to communicate openly with your parents about how you feel, expressing your need for more focus and validation. It may also help to find support from friends or other trusted adults who can provide emotional understanding and encouragement.

Judge justification: The response lacks direct engagement with the user's specific concerns about exam anxiety and fear of parental reaction. While it attempts to offer empathy, it misinterprets the user's situation, suggesting a lack of attention rather than addressing the fear of failure and parental disapproval. The advice to communicate openly is somewhat useful, but it doesn't fully address the user's immediate emotional distress or provide specific coping strategies for exam anxiety. The re …[truncated]
