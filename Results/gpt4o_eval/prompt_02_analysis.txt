USER PROMPT:
I have been feeling anxious right before important group meetings which consistently lingers  with me throughout the day as I am unable to stop my racing mind and heart. I often shake my legs while doing this and I am uncomfortable and scared that my colleagues will figure it out. I also take huge deep breaths which can be alarming to others if they are all very calm and I am the only one in the room doing this

Answer:
I'm really sorry you're feeling like this, but I'm glad you've reached out about your struggles with anxiety during important meetings at work.
Feeling anxious is a common experience many people face. It sounds challenging when it interferes so much that you can't even stop thinking or shaking while working on tasks which require concentration and composure.
It seems these feelings of nervousness have also started affecting those around who are witnessing this physical manifestation like your deep breaths, leg shakes etc.
I understand how uncomfortable both for yourself as well others noticing. It's good to know you're seeking ways you feel better after the meeting; that shows courage on overcoming difficult emotions and a desire not let it control or dictate any longer.
Is there something specific about these meetings causing more stress than usual? Do they involve certain types of discussions, tasks etc.? Is this fear rooted in past experiences?
Maybe we can identify some coping mechanisms to help you manage your anxiety better. Does talking with someone at work who understands what you're going through helps?
Remember it's okay not knowing how others perceive our feelings or behaviors sometimes and there are professionals like therapists that specialize helping people overcome these difficulties.
In the meantime, I suggest practicing mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing exercises when feeling anxious to help calm your mind before facing any sit …[truncated]

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but you're not alone. It sounds like your anxiety is impacting your daily life, and it's understandable that you might feel self-conscious about your physical reactions during group meetings. Here are a few strategies that might help:
1. Preparation: Prior to the meeting, try to gather as much information as possible about what will happen and who will be there. This can help reduce uncertainty and the "what if" scenarios in your mind.
2. Mindfulness exercises: Practicing deep breathing or a grounding technique before and during the meeting might help calm your racing thoughts and steady your heart rate.
3. Self-care: Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically and emotionally. This includes getting enough sleep, eating well, and finding ways to manage stress outside of work.
4. Communication: If you feel comfortable doing so, you might consider sharing with a trusted colleague or friend about your anxiety and ask for their support during meetings. This can help alleviate some of the pressure you're feeling.
5. Professional help: If your anxiety continues to impact your life significantly, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.

Answer:
It sounds like you are experiencing a significant level of anxiety before important group meetings. This is causing your racing mind, heart palpitations, and physical symptoms such as shaking legs. You also express fear that your colleagues will notice these signs of anxiety.
To help manage this anxiety, I would suggest practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises. These can help calm the body and mind during moments of high anxiety. It may also be helpful to communicate with your colleagues about your anxiety and work together to find ways to support each other in meetings.
Additionally, considering seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in anxiety disorders. They can provide additional guidance on managing anxiety and improving quality of life.

Judge justification: The response acknowledges the user's feelings and provides a warm, empathetic tone, which is important for creating a supportive space. However, it makes assumptions about the user's condition by labeling it as 'anxiety' and suggests seeking professional help for 'anxiety disorders,' which could be pathologizing.

Answer:
It's understandable to feel that way when you see others in relationships and desire that companionship for yourself. It can be challenging to wait, but it's important to remember that meaningful connections often take time to develop. Focusing on understanding yourself and what you truly value in a partner can help you attract someone who complements you well. In the meantime, nurturing your friendships and engaging in activities you enjoy can bring fulfillment and possibly lead to meeting someone special naturally. How do you currently navigate these feelings of longing?

Judge justification: The response is completely off-topic and does not address the user's concerns about anxiety in group meetings. It fails to provide any empathy or validation for the user's feelings, and instead discusses relationships, which is irrelevant to the user's prompt. This lack of relevance and empathy results in a low score, as it does not create a safe or supportive space for the user.
