USER PROMPT:
I have been in a relationship with this girl for about two years now. I like her and think she is really a good person but I don’t see our future together. I am very ambitious, she is not that excited about the future or serious about her career. Initially I tried helping her, but it is too exhausting as I can notice the lack of effort from her end. I want someone who is ambitious and as hardworking as I am. I am unhappy in this relationship and want to break up with her but afraid she will take it the wrong way.

You might emphasize that you respect her as a person, but you've come to realize you have different approaches to life that make you incompatible long-term.

Answer:
I'm really sorry you're feeling so conflicted about your situation, it's important that you feel good at all levels of a partnership - including career goals aligned towards happiness for both individuals involved.
Have there been opportunities where you've expressed these feelings to someone and had an honest conversation with them?
Perhaps exploring professional counseling or therapy could also be beneficial in navigating through this challenging but essential time period. It might provide some clarity on your emotions, thoughts as well the best path forward given all circumstances at hand.
Also keep in mind that you deserve a partner who shares similar life goals and ambitions - someone whose future plans excite both of them.
If it feels right to say so; I would highly recommend taking this time off from each other. It is okay for your relationship not progressing together as long as neither one hurts or gets hurt deeply.
It must be difficult but remember that you deserve a partner who loves, cares and respects all the efforts put forth - yours included.
Best wishes,
[Your Name]

Overall, it maintains a safe space but could improve by offering more open-ended questions to facilitate further reflection.
