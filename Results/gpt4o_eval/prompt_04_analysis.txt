It's understandable that you're struggling to find hope right now. The pain of losing someone you love can be overwhelming. However, I want to assure you that it's possible to find ways to cope with your grief and learn to live with it over time.
One thing that might help is finding ways to honor their memory and keep them close in your daily life. This could mean doing something they loved, looking at old photos, or even talking about them to someone who will listen.

Answer:
I'm truly sorry for your loss, that must be incredibly difficult after losing such dear ones at once. Grieving is an immensely personal journey; finding a path forward often takes time.
Finding support in friends or family can provide comfort as you remember and honor their lives together during this tough period of grief. It's okay to take it one day at a time—there's no right way, only what feels appropriate for your emotional state.
Seeking the companionship from groups who share similar experiences may also offer solace; connecting with others who've faced profound loss can help in feeling less alone.
In terms of finding hope and carrying on:
- Allow yourself space to mourn without judgment – tears are a natural part of grieving. They express both sorrow over lost loved ones as well as happiness for them.
- Consider engaging activities that bring you some joy or relaxation; this might be light-hearted reading, walks in nature, hobbies you've enjoyed before the loss...
- Remember it's perfectly normal if life feels overwhelming at times—it may help to acknowledge these feelings and give yourself permission not just to grieve but also celebrate their lives by making meaningful memories.
May your loved ones continue guiding you with kindness. If there’s a way I can further assist or provide support, please let me know.
