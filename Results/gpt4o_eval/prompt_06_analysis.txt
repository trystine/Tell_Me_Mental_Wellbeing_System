USER PROMPT:
I grew up in a very orthodox household, my father abused my mother. Even though the physical abuse has stopped I still find him abusing my mom verbally. This behaviour has deeply affected me since childhood, I grew up thinking that all men are like that. This makes me incapable of trusting men and forming an emotional relationship with them. I am too scared to trust them and this has led to me avoiding them throughout my life.

Answer:
Thank you for sharing something so personal and difficult. Growing up witnessing abuse between your parents has clearly had a profound impact on how you view relationships and trust.
It's completely understandable that you've developed this protective response - avoiding men and finding it difficult to trust them is your mind's way of keeping you safe from what you've observed as dangerous or harmful.
The ongoing verbal abuse in your home continues to reinforce these fears, which makes healing particularly challenging. Your experience has created a deep wound that affects how you connect with others.
Would you be open to exploring some gentle steps toward healing? This doesn't mean immediately trusting men or forcing yourself into uncomfortable situations. Rather, it might involve working with a trauma-informed therapist who specializes in childhood experiences like yours, examining these patterns at your own pace, and gradually challenging some of these beliefs when you feel ready.
Your awareness of these patterns is actually an important first step. How have you been coping with these feelings so far?

Answer:
I'm really sorry to hear about your experiences growing up in such a difficult environment. It sounds like you have been deeply affected by the violence and abuse you witnessed, and it has left lasting impacts on your ability to form emotional relationships with others. This is a common experience for people who grew up in abusive households, as it can create patterns of distrust and fear that make it difficult to connect with others.
One approach to dealing with this is to seek out therapy, which can help you process the trauma you experienced and learn coping mechanisms to manage your emotions and build trust. It may also be helpful to find support groups or communities where you can connect with others who have had similar experiences, as this can provide a sense of validation and understanding that can be healing.
In addition to seeking professional help, it may be beneficial to explore self-care practices that can help you manage your emotions and build resilience. This could include things like meditation, exercise, journaling, or spending time in nature. It's important to prioritize taking care of yourself and nurturing your own wellbeing as a way of building the foundation for healthy relationships in the future.
I wish you all the best as you navigate this difficult journey, and I am here to support you however I can. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to reach out.

Answer:
I'm really sorry you're experiencing such a difficult situation; it sounds incredibly tough for you, both emotionally and psychologically. It must be very hard dealing with the aftermath of growing up in an abusive environment.
It's important first that your mother receives support too – whether through family intervention or seeking help from professionals who can provide her protection against verbal abuse as well.
It’s also crucial to acknowledge how deeply this has affected you, especially regarding trust issues. This is a common consequence for many people who've lived with domestic violence and it's not something you're alone in feeling.
One step could be exploring therapy where trained mental health practitioners are present who understand your experiences better than anyone else would know (like myself).
Remember that there isn't anything wrong or defective about you because of this upbringing – these negative influences don't define the full scope, depth nor capability for trust and emotional connection.
You have so much to offer in life! You may start by talking openly with a therapist who can guide your healing process.
It's also worth looking into support groups where individuals share similar experiences; it often helps knowing you're not alone even if you think you've been isolated all along.
Remember, it's okay for this journey of recovery and self-discovery to take time. But each step forward is progress toward breaking free from the past's …[truncated]
