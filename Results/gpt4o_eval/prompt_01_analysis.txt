Answer:
It's understandable to feel that longing for companionship, especially when you see friends moving through relationships around you. That feeling of "when will it be my turn?" can be quite profound. The desire for meaningful connection is deeply human. While there's no predetermined timeline for when you'll meet someone special, this period of being on your own might be offering you valuable time for self-discovery and clarity about what you truly want in a relationship.
