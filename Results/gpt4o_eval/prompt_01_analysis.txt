USER PROMPT:
I sometimes feel alone. I deeply crave companionship or someone to share my day to day life with. I am surrounded by my friends who hop from one relationship to another and often I just wonder when it will happen to me. When will I find someone special with whom I can be with?

Answer:
It sounds like you are feeling a sense of loneliness and longing for companionship. It's normal to crave connection with others, especially during times of change or uncertainty in relationships. However, it's important to remember that finding someone special is not the only source of fulfillment and happiness. Building meaningful connections with friends and family, engaging in activities you enjoy, and taking care of yourself can also contribute to a sense of companionship and well-being.
It's understandable that you may feel envious or anxious about when it will happen to you, but try not to compare yourself too much to others. Everyone's journey is unique, and finding the right person takes time. Focus on nurturing your own growth and happiness in the meantime.
Remember that companionship comes in different forms, and it's okay if it doesn't always look like what you expect or want. Be open to new experiences and connections, as they may bring unexpected joy and fulfillment.
