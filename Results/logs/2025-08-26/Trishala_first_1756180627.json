Even though the physical abuse has stopped I still find him abusing my mom verbally. This behaviour has deeply affected me since childhood, I grew up thinking that all men are like that. This makes me incapable of trusting men and forming an emotional relationship with them. I am too scared to trust them and this has led to me avoiding them throughout my life.”\n"},{"role":"bot","message":"I'm so sorry to hear that you've had to go through such a difficult childhood experience, Sweetheart. It's completely understandable that it would leave a lasting impact on your ability to trust others, especially men. The fact that your father still engages in verbal abuse towards your mother is also very concerning.\n\nCan you tell me more about how this has affected your relationships with men over the years? What are some specific fears or doubts that have held you back from forming emotional connections with them?"}]},{"arm":"nonrag","num_turns":2,"helpful":3,"supportive":3,"clarity":3,"groundedness":3,"overall":3,"comments":"check 2","turns":[{"role":"user","message":"Hi"},{"role":"bot","message":"It's lovely to connect with you!

It's completely okay if you'd rather not say anything specific right now. We can simply be here together in this calm space.
